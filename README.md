# Accounting_Cycle_V3
# As I talked about in the second iteration of the accoutning project, I was going to add networking capabilities to the project. Really neat and challenging part that I enjoyed doing. The programs will periodically send the newest copy of the journal out to their saved IPs and port numbers. You can test the networking part if you send a copy of the storage.py file via the test networking file to the main. It will not say the external change is verified which is because I changed the input for initial hash generation and did not update the journal, hashbank, etc. *Important* make sure you run as administrator or you will get an errno 13 on startup.
